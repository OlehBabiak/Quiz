// Description
// Hue & Shade: A single color within the palette is made up of a hue such as "grey",
// and shade, such as "500". "grey 50" is the lightest shade of grey,
// while "grey 900" is the darkest. In addition, most hubs come with "accent"/"alternative" shades,
// prefixed with an "A".

// Given a HUE (blue, grey, etc.) and a SHADE (500, 600, etc.) you can use the color like this:
//
// import { grey } from './colors';
// const primary = blue[500];

export const color = {
